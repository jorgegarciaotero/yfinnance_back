## Pipeline — Cloud Run Jobs (`europe-west1`)

All jobs use the image `europe-west1-docker.pkg.dev/yfinance-gcp/stock-jobs/stock-jobs:latest` with `command: python`.

### Execution order (daily, after market close)

```
daily-prices-job  →  daily-enrich-job  →  daily-sector-job  ┐
                                       └→  daily-anomaly-job ┴→  daily-news-job  →  daily-narrative-job
```

| Job | Script | Frequency | What it does |
|-----|--------|-----------|--------------|
| `daily-prices-job` | `src/jobs/daily_prices.py` | Daily | Downloads OHLCV prices from Yahoo Finance for all active symbols. MERGE into `daily_prices` by `(date, symbol)`. On first run: full backfill. |
| `daily-enrich-job` | `src/jobs/daily_enrich.py` | Daily (after prices) | Joins prices + company fundamentals + computes technical indicators (RSI, SMA, Bollinger, MACD, momentum). Full load if table is >7 days stale, otherwise incremental MERGE over a 30-day window. Writes to `enriched_prices_table`. |
| `daily-sector-job` | `src/jobs/daily_sector_opportunities.py` | Daily (after enrich) | Runs the sector opportunities SQL. For each sector produces top 10 picks × 3 setup types (Dip / Momentum / Value Reversal), each scored 0–100. DELETE + INSERT on `max_date` (idempotent). Writes to `sector_daily_opportunities`. |
| `daily-anomaly-job` | `src/jobs/daily_anomaly_radar.py` | Daily (after enrich) | Detects market anomalies in 3 categories (Spike / Oversold / Momentum). Scans only 40 days with LAG(). Top 5 per sector. Idempotent DELETE + INSERT. Writes to `anomaly_radar`. |
| `daily-news-job` | `src/jobs/daily_news_enrich.py` | Daily (after sector + anomaly) | Fetches news and social mentions for every symbol in today's radar + opportunities output. Sources: Yahoo Finance news (yfinance) and Reddit (r/stocks, r/investing, r/wallstreetbets). No API keys required. Writes to `company_news`. |
| `daily-narrative-job` | `src/jobs/daily_narrative.py` | Daily (after news) | For each symbol in today's radar + opportunities, picks the top news from `company_news` and calls Claude Haiku to generate a 3-sentence dealflow narrative. MERGEs `top_news_title`, `top_news_url`, `narrative` into both output tables. Requires `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` secret. |
| `weekly-companies` | `src/jobs/weekly_companies.py` | Weekly (Sundays) | Refreshes the company universe (S&P 500, Russell 2000, STOXX 600, commodity ETFs, bond ETFs). Validates each symbol against Yahoo Finance and updates fundamental metadata. MERGE into `companies` by `(symbol, updated_at)` — accumulates weekly history. |

### Redeploy

```bash
bash deploy.sh
```

Builds the image via Cloud Build and updates all jobs. `daily-scanner-job` is automatically deleted if it exists (obsolete — was pointing to a removed script).

## `anomaly_radar` — Daily market anomaly detector

Daily market anomaly radar. Scans only the last 40 days of `enriched_prices_table` using LAG windows (minimum cost). Partitioned by `date`, clustered by `anomaly_type` and `sector`.

**Anomaly types:**
- `Volume/Price Spike` — strong price impulse (≥3% in 1d, ≥7% in 3d, or ≥10% in 7d) with volume ≥1.5× the 20-day average.

## `sector_daily_opportunities` — Sector-based daily investment setups

**The main output table.** Updated every trading day after market close. For each sector, extracts up to 10 companies in three distinct setup categories, each with a composite score (0–100) and a plain-English reason. Partitioned by `date`, clustered by `sector` and `setup_type` for efficient queries.
